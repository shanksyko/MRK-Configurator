# Restore to Branch 89 Snapshot

- Backup tag created: `backup-pre-revert-20250926182535`.
- Backup branch created: `backup/local-changes-20250926182535`.
- Restored working tree to commit `c1ba1f46d99ca4dc82871c40008e00429068efb2` (branch 89 snapshot).
- Created restore branch `restore/from-89-20250926182623` from that snapshot.
- .NET SDK is unavailable in this execution environment (`dotnet` command not found), so Debug/Release builds could not be validated locally.

The repository state now reflects the code from branch 89 with this documentation added.
