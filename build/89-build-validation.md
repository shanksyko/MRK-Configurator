# 89 Build Validation Attempt

- `git checkout 89`: failed because the reference does not exist in the repository.
- `.NET SDK` commands (`dotnet nuget locals`, `dotnet clean`, `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`) were attempted but are unavailable in the current environment (`dotnet` command not found).
- Promotion to `main` could not be executed due to the absence of the `main` branch and remote tracking references.

This document records the commands that were attempted per the requested procedure and the reasons they could not be completed successfully in this environment.
